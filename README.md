## Agile SDLC Model
The Agile model is employed to ensure iterative development and prompt feedback, allowing adjustments based on user needs.

### Phases in Agile SDLC
1. **Concept Initiation**:
   - Identify project requirements.
   - Define scope and objectives.

2. **Planning**:
   - Create user stories and prioritize the product backlog.
   - Identify sprint goals and milestones.

3. **Design**:
   - Develop wireframes and user interface designs.
   - Set up the architecture for scalability and responsiveness.

4. **Development**:
   - Implement features in iterative sprints.
   - Focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) early.

5. **Testing**:
   - Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance testing after every sprint.
   - Ensure performance and security testing before deployment.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy updates incrementally.
   - Collect user feedback post-release.

7. **Maintenance and Feedback**:
   - Continuously update and improve based on feedback.
   - Implement hotfixes and ensure system uptime.
